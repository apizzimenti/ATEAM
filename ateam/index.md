The **A**lgebraic **t**opology-**e**nabled **a**lgorith**m**s (**ATEAM**) library is a high-performance software suite for conducting experiments on lattice spin models. The main attractions are the _plaquette [invaded-cluster](http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9605103)_ and _plaquette [Swendsen-Wang](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.58.86)_ algorithms for simulating Markov chains on cubical lattices of any dimension.
